# Overview
Theoretically it is oriented for web, but it seems that it's more of a presentation of JS and Node.js
The point of this soft is to make a place from where I (and possibly you) can grab text info and put it into an AI for analysis.
It's a bit uncomfortable to grab site contents when you have adds all around the place and multiple banners and other things, right?
So here you can read stuff without any interuptions, copy parts or grab txt file. I wanted to implement a translation option but it seems that for bigger chuncks of text 
free APIs is not a working solution. Theoretically I will be able to set up a locally hosted AI to do that, but not in this version.

# Future Work

- Frontend looks prettier and cleaner, with paragraphs and translation part hidden untill button to translate is pressed
- Locally hosted AI with API to translate info
